## Purpose
This repository is designed to help those transitioning from `Pandas` to `Polars` become acquainted with `Polars`' syntax. Most of the code examples are sourced from the excellent [Polars user guide](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars/user-guide/). Each example features both `Polars` and `Pandas` code, encouraging you to practice converting `Polars` to `Pandas` independently. If you encounter challenges with `Polars`, you can refer to my solutions for guidance. I believe that with these hints, you'll develop even better solutions of your own. This approach will enable you to swiftly grasp `Polars` through the familiar lens of `Pandas`.

## Why take this approach?
Converting code from `Polars` to `Pandas` involves a three-step process:

1. Familiarizing with `Polars`: First, you must acquaint yourself with `Polars`' syntax to understand its meaning.
2. Converting to `Pandas`: During the conversion process, you'll need to determine how to accomplish tasks using `Pandas`.
3. Comparing the results: Finally, you'll compare the results and gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of both libraries.

This approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of both `Polars` and `Pandas`, enabling you to make informed decisions when working with data manipulation libraries.
